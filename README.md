:atom_symbol: A deep study about the React Framework internals based on rewriting it by hand

## ðŸŒ† How React works
In react we work with something called **Fiber Tree**.

A **Fiber Tree** is a simple concept that revolves around the way react works internally treating all **DOM Elements** as a **Element Tree** in order to render all of them (we can call it a **Linked List** of **DOM Elements** as well).

Below you can see a simple example (credits on [Extra](#extra-info)):

1. Every element is a **fiber**. Besides, it can have a **sibling** or a **parent**.

<br />

2. Once we finish making work on a **fiber**, if it has a **child**, it will be the next work we'll get done. So, if we're making some work on the **div**, after we finish it we'll make some work on the **child** **h1**.

<br />

3. Once we finish the work and the current **fiber** has no **children**, we'll look to get some work done on the **sibling**. By the example, after making work on **p**, we'll get some work done on **a**.

<br />

4. After making the work on the **sibling**, we'll go up the its **parent**. If the **parent** does not have any **children** or some work to be done, we go the **uncle** (the **sibling** of the **parent**).

<br />

5. In the end of all work process, we'll reach the **root** **fiber** and everything is ready to be rendered by the browser.
